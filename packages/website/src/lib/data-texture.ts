/**
 * Authored data uploaded as a texture, so a shader can read it instead of the
 * CPU baking the answer into instance attributes every frame.
 *
 * This is the piece that lets a tilemap become a *static* scene: upload one
 * instance per grid cell once, put the per-cell payload (which tile, which
 * layer, how lit) in a texture, and let the vertex shader look up its own cell.
 * `program.draw({ instanceCount })` then draws the whole map with zero per-frame
 * bytes.
 *
 * ## Why the data is 8-bit
 *
 * `createTexture` accepts a `TexImageSource`, and `ImageData` is one of those
 * types. Therefore an RGBA8 data texture needs no change to the library. There is
 * no path to upload float data or 16-bit data.
 *
 * The 8-bit limit costs precision, but it does not prevent the technique. A tile
 * index fits in one byte, and a quantised distance also fits in one byte. Put the
 * values in bytes, and decode them in the shader with `floor(channel * 255 + 0.5)`.
 *
 * ## flipY must be false
 *
 * With `flipY: false`, both backends put source row 0 at v=0. WebGL2 uses
 * `UNPACK_FLIP_Y_WEBGL`, and WebGPU uses `copyExternalImageToTexture`. Row indexes
 * are therefore the same after the upload, and the two backends agree.
 *
 * BroMetal gives a warning about the direction of V. That warning applies to render
 * targets, where the order of rasterization of a full-screen quad is different. It
 * does not apply to images that you upload.
 *
 * The default value of `flipY` is `true`. That value turns the map upside down, and
 * it gives no error message. For a tilemap, the result looks like an error in the
 * level generator and not an error in the upload.
