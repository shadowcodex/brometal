/**
 * A small sprite layer above BroMetal. A 2D or 2.3D game framework can use this
 * shape.
 *
 * There are three parts:
 *  - `spriteAtlas` changes a tile index into the UV rectangle that the shader
 *    needs.
 *  - `SpriteBatch` is an instance pool with spare capacity. Call `push()` for each
 *    sprite. Then upload the four arrays and call
 *    `draw({ instanceCount: batch.count })`. The capacity only increases, so a
 *    batch that grows and becomes smaller does not allocate again.
 *  - `billboardBasis` calculates the axes of a billboard quad from the view matrix
 *    of a camera.
 *
 * `SpriteBatch.sort` is the work that the cut-out method removes. Cut-out sprites
 * write depth, so the GPU puts them in order and the CPU does not touch the array.
 * The function remains because the blended demo cannot be correct without it. That
 * difference is the purpose of the comparison.
 *
 * Give each batch its own program. Several uploads into one program in one frame
 * are correct, but only because the WebGPU backend writes each one at a new buffer
 * offset. Separate programs show the intent, and they keep the buffers independent.
